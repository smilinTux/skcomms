# skcomms — Standard Operating Procedures

Sovereign realm-aware comms protocol: defines *what a message is* between AI agents
(FQID-addressed `<agent>@<operator>.<realm>`, PGP/PQC-signed envelopes), carries it over
pluggable transports, and serves the SKFed S2S federation surface. Consumed by skchat,
skchat-app, skcapstone, and peer nodes. **Crypto component** — governed by the
sk-standards [CRYPTOGRAPHY_STANDARD](https://github.com/smilinTux/sk-standards/blob/main/standards/CRYPTOGRAPHY_STANDARD.md).

## 1. Overview

**Owns:** the Envelope v1 format + canonical signing bytes (`envelope.py`), the FQID
identity model (`identity.py`, `cluster.py`), the signing/verification layer
(`EnvelopeSigner` / `EnvelopeVerifier`, `signing.py`, `crypto.py`), the ACK / replay /
sender-binding layer (`ack.py`), the transport router + adapters (`transports/`,
`adapters/`, `router.py`), the CoT (Cursor-on-Target) codec + TAK bridge (`cot.py`,
`cot_service.py`), the SKFed S2S API (inbox, prekey, directory — `skfed_directory.py`,
`skfed_resolve.py`), and the per-realm discovery registry (`registry.py`).

**Does NOT do:** UI/chat experience (that's [skchat](https://github.com/smilinTux/skchat)
/ [skchat-app](https://github.com/smilinTux/skchat-app)), identity root-of-trust or key
custody (that's [capauth](https://github.com/smilinTux/capauth)), or the standards
themselves (that's [sk-standards](https://github.com/smilinTux/sk-standards)).

**Start here** (entry-point files a reader should open first):
- `src/skcomms/envelope.py` — Envelope v1 schema, `canonical_bytes()`, `sig_suite`/`kem_suite` ids.
- `src/skcomms/signing.py` + `src/skcomms/crypto.py` — signature layer and the negotiated payload-wrap (hybrid-KEM gate).
- `src/skcomms/ack.py` — ACK tracker with sender-binding (rejects ACKs not from the intended recipient).
- `src/skcomms/api.py` — FastAPI SKFed S2S app (inbox / prekey / directory / announce).
- `src/skcomms/transports/` + `src/skcomms/adapters/base.py` — transport router legs and the `ChannelAdapter` ABC.

## 3. Build

Python package (`src/skcomms`). `python -m venv ~/.skenv && ~/.skenv/bin/pip install -e ".[cli,crypto]"`.
PQ legs bind liboqs (ML-KEM-768 / ML-DSA-65) via `oqs`; pure-pyca/pgpy paths run without
it and fall back to the classical suite. We **bind vetted crypto, never hand-roll**
primitives.

## 4. Test

`pytest` — unit + integration (envelope signing, crypto negotiation, ACK sender-binding,
directory, registry, adapters). Green bar gates release. PQ tests skip cleanly when
liboqs / `oqs` is absent. `ruff check .` + `black --check .` for lint.

## 5. Release / Deploy

Library release: bump `version` in `pyproject.toml`, add a dated `CHANGELOG.md` entry,
run the gate (`pytest` + `ruff`), `git tag vX.Y.Z`, push. Service runs as a `systemd`
user unit invoking `uvicorn skcomms.api:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 9384` (or
`skcomms serve`).

### Front-end / Exposure

Per sk-standards
[UNIFIED_INGRESS_STANDARD.md](https://github.com/smilinTux/sk-standards/blob/main/standards/UNIFIED_INGRESS_STANDARD.md):

- **Ingress tier:** `0 Direct (Tailscale Funnel :443 path-route)`. Single node,
  federation endpoints mounted straight onto Funnel — no reverse proxy. This is how
  `.158` and `.41` run today.
- **Public `:443` route(s)** — the *only* internet-facing surface (path-preserved Funnel
  mounts onto `skcomms.api`), every request self-authenticating at the envelope layer:
  - `POST /api/v1/inbox` — S2S signed-envelope receive (routed to `inbox/<agent>`).
  - `GET|POST /api/v1/prekey` — hybrid-KEM prekey publish/fetch.
  - `GET /.well-known/skfed/directory` — CapAuth-signed per-realm directory.
  - `POST /api/v1/skfed/announce` — gated self-announce into the realm directory.
- **Bind addresses (NEVER an internet-exposed port):**
  - **S2S inbox / API — `127.0.0.1:9384`** (`skcomms.api`, default `--host 127.0.0.1`).
    Reached from the internet *only* via the Funnel `:443` mount above; the socket itself
    is loopback.
  - **Prekey / inbox daemon-proxy — `:8765`** (`node_registry.py` `DEFAULT_DAEMON_PORT`,
    `transports/websocket.py` default `ws://localhost:8765/skcomms/ws`). Serves
    `/api/v1/inbox` + `/api/v1/prekey` to peers **over the tailnet** (e.g.
    `http://100.x.x.x:8765/...`) — **not** Funnel-exposed, **never** bound to a public
    interface.
  - **CoT / TAK stream — `cot_service.py`** defaults to `0.0.0.0` on the **tailnet only**
    (real ATAK/iTAK clients); it is a separate, non-federation surface and is **not**
    Funnel-exposed. Keep it firewalled to the tailscale interface.
- **Rule:** Funnel `:443` is the sole ingress. No skcomms socket is ever published to a
  public interface directly.

#### Browser origins / CORS

The same `skcomms.api` app that Funnel exposes also carries loopback-gated **operator**
surfaces: `POST /mcp` fires desktop notifications, `POST /api/v1/send` sends messages as
the agent, and the consent endpoints (`/api/v1/consent/*`) trust the client IP, which a
browser running on the operator's own machine satisfies. A permissive
`Access-Control-Allow-Origin` therefore lets **any web page the operator visits** drive
those operator actions cross-origin from inside the trust boundary. CORS is not an
authentication layer, it only decides which origins a browser will let script the API, so
it is scoped tight:

- **Allowlist is empty by default.** No cross-origin browser request is approved unless an
  origin is explicitly listed. There is no wildcard.
- Configure via `SKCOMMS_CORS_ORIGINS`: a comma-separated list of exact origins (scheme +
  host + optional port), e.g. `SKCOMMS_CORS_ORIGINS=https://hub.skworld.io,http://localhost:3000`.
  Whitespace is trimmed and blank entries dropped (`api._cors_allow_origins`).
- **Which surfaces need a browser:** none of the public federation routes in this section
  (`/api/v1/inbox`, `/api/v1/prekey`, `/.well-known/skfed/directory`,
  `/api/v1/skfed/announce`) are browser-driven, they are server-to-server and
  self-authenticating at the envelope layer, so they need no CORS entry. The operator
  surfaces (`/mcp`, `/api/v1/send`, `/api/v1/consent/*`) are reached from the same host and
  likewise need none by default. Add an origin ONLY for a specific first-party web client
  you intend to let script the API from a browser, and only for the host that serves it.

## 6. Configuration / Usage

API port from config (default 9384, `config.py` / `mcp_server.py`). Peers wired in
`peers.json` (FQID → Syncthing device id + PGP fingerprint, TOFU-bound). Realm/operator
come from `~/.skcapstone/cluster.json`; the `agent` component resolves via capauth. All
paths honor the `SKCOMMS_HOME` override (default `~/.skcomms`). `SK_STANDALONE=1` forces
standalone mode. Secrets are never inlined — keys come from the agent's CapAuth profile.

### Housekeeping / retention

The file-based rails are append-only at write time: sender outboxes
(`{id}.skc.json`), receiver `archive/` dirs, and mailbox outbox records all grow
without bound unless swept (a 140k-file outbox once pegged Syncthing and froze a
fleet laptop). Retention is configured in the `housekeeping:` block of
`config.yml` (`skcomms.config.HousekeepingConfig`); defaults:

| Key | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `enabled` | `true` | run the background housekeeping loop in the daemon |
| `interval_s` | `3600` | seconds between daemon passes (hourly) |
| `outbox_max_age_hours` | `48` | sender-outbox envelopes older than this are deleted (`prune_outbox`) |
| `archive_ttl_hours` | `168` (7 days) | receiver-archive files older than this are deleted (`prune_archive`) |
| `mailbox_ttl_hours` | `168` (7 days) | mailbox outbox records (`<realm>/<operator>/<agent>/outbox/*.json`) older than this are deleted |

The running API daemon starts the loop automatically from `api.lifespan`
(`skcomms.housekeeping.housekeeping_loop`). `skcomms housekeep` runs one full
pass on demand (outbox prune + archive TTL + mailbox retention) and is the verb
to call from a systemd timer or cron as belt-and-braces on hosts where the
daemon is not always up. Per-run overrides: `--outbox-max-age-hours`,
`--archive-ttl-hours`, `--mailbox-ttl-hours`; `--json-out` prints
machine-readable counts.

## 7. API / Reference

FastAPI app `skcomms.api:app`. Health `GET /health`; status `GET /api/v1/status`;
capabilities `GET /api/v1/capabilities`; federation routes per §5. CLI:
`skcomms init`, `skcomms send <fqid> <msg>`, `skcomms inbox`, `skcomms peers add`,
`skcomms registry resolve`, `skcomms grant …`, `skcomms serve`,
`skcomms housekeep` (one full retention pass, timer-friendly; see §6). Full command matrix in
[README.md](README.md) and [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).

## 8. Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Check |
|---|---|
| Peer envelope 401 / replay | `EnvelopeVerifier` order (signature → freshness → replay); clock skew; pinned fingerprint TOFU mismatch |
| ACK ignored / rejected | `ack.py` sender-binding — an ACK whose `sender != intended recipient` is dropped as forgery; check the pending entry's recipient |
| Funnel path 404 | each federation path mounted at its *full* target path (`--set-path` preserves path) |
| Peer can't reach `:8765` | daemon-proxy binds the tailnet, not loopback-only; verify tailscale up + firewall allows tailscale0 |
| PQ leg unavailable | `liboqs` / `oqs` importable; otherwise negotiation falls back to the classical suite (expected, logged) |
| CoT/TAK client can't connect | `cot_service.py` bound to tailnet iface; confirm ATAK/iTAK points at the tailscale IP, not the Funnel host |
| Outbox / archive growing unbounded, Syncthing pegged | daemon housekeeping loop running? (`housekeeping.enabled`, `api.lifespan` log line "Housekeeping loop started"); run `skcomms housekeep --json-out` for an immediate sweep; see §6 retention table |

## 9. Maturity-tier + Version reference

**Crypto maturity: T1 (Agile), with T2 (Hybrid KEM) implemented on the negotiated
payload-wrap surface; T3 (Hybrid sig) in progress.** Honest, surface-scoped basis
(per the T0–T4 self-assessment in
[CRYPTOGRAPHY_STANDARD.md](https://github.com/smilinTux/sk-standards/blob/main/standards/CRYPTOGRAPHY_STANDARD.md)):

- **T1 — Agile: DONE.** Machine-readable suite-ids on every container
  (`envelope.py`: `sig_suite` / `kem_suite`), a suite registry (`skcomms.crypto_suites`),
  a single negotiation gate (`pqdm.negotiate_suite` / `ChatCrypto.negotiated_suite`), and
  a runtime **self-report** surface (`skcomms pqc-report` CLI → the `sksecurity`
  honesty engine `build_project_report`). Downgrade is *detectable* — the negotiated suite id is bound into the
  result, so a stripped hybrid leg no longer reports hybrid.
- **T2 — Hybrid KEM: implemented on the payload-wrap surface (peer-negotiated, not yet
  universal).** `crypto.py:EnvelopeCrypto` negotiates hybrid **X25519 + ML-KEM-768**
  (FIPS 203) **by default when the peer's bundle supports it**, combining as
  `K = HKDF-SHA256(X25519_ss ‖ MLKEM768_ss)` — concatenate-then-KDF, never XOR, never
  pure-PQ. Harvest-Now-Decrypt-Later is neutralised **only when both peers support
  hybrid**; a classical-only peer still negotiates the classical wrap (honest, logged).
- **T3 — Hybrid sig: IN PROGRESS.** The hybrid signature suite `mldsa65-ed25519-v2`
  (ML-DSA-65 + Ed25519, FIPS 204) is wired (`HYBRID_SIG_SUITE`), but the **default
  `sig_suite` is still classical `ed25519-v1`**. Signatures are therefore
  classically forgeable post-quantum — a *future-forgery* risk (deferrable, not HNDL).
- **T4 — Transport-closed: not claimed.** Tailnet / media / CoT legs are classical and
  documented as such in §5.
- **Symmetric/hash floor:** AES-256-GCM bulk + SHA-256 integrity are quantum-acceptable
  (Grover-only, ≥128-bit). AES-256 is **not** "broken" by quantum.

**CRYPTOGRAPHY_STANDARD compliance:** hybrid KEM `HKDF(X25519 ‖ MLKEM768)` (FIPS 203) on
the negotiated payload wrap; ML-DSA-65 + Ed25519 (FIPS 204) signature suite wired,
classical default; every claim is scoped to surface + FIPS number + hybrid-vs-classical.
Forbidden words ("quantum-proof", "quantum-safe", "unbreakable", "CNSA 2.0", "FIPS 206",
"Falcon") are not used — this is the **-768 hybrid tier**, post-quantum / quantum-resistant.
**CRYPTO_AGILITY:** wire tags (`sig_suite`/`kem_suite`) + `skcomms.crypto_suites` registry
+ single-gate negotiation with downgrade-detection — see
[CRYPTO_AGILITY_STANDARD.md](https://github.com/smilinTux/sk-standards/blob/main/standards/CRYPTO_AGILITY_STANDARD.md).

**Version:** SemVer per `pyproject.toml` (`0.1.6`). VERSION_LIFECYCLE phase: **Active**
(pre-1.0 `0.x`; only the latest published `0.x` line gets security fixes). Experimental,
self-built reference implementation — **not** independently security-audited; see
[SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

## 10. Cold-machine standup runbook

Standing the daemon up on a fresh host, end to end. The shipped artifacts live in
`contrib/systemd/` (the `systemd` **user** units) and `scripts/bootstrap.sh` (the
idempotent installer). Re-running any step is safe.

### One-shot bootstrap

```bash
git clone https://github.com/smilinTux/skcomms && cd skcomms
scripts/bootstrap.sh
```

That single command, in order:

1. **venv**: creates `~/.skenv` if missing (override with `SKCOMMS_VENV`), upgrades pip.
2. **install**: `pip install -e ".[api,cli,crypto]"`. If a pinned lockfile
   `constraints.txt` is present at the repo root it installs with `-c constraints.txt`;
   otherwise it falls back to unpinned resolution.
3. **scaffold**: `skcomms init` builds the `<realm>/<operator>/<agent>/{outbox,inbox}`
   tree plus the top-level `.stignore` (idempotent; honors `SKCOMMS_HOME`).
4. **units**: installs `skcomms-api.service`, `skcomms-housekeep.service`, and
   `skcomms-housekeep.timer` into `~/.config/systemd/user/`, then
   `systemctl --user enable --now` on the API service and the housekeeping timer.
5. **Funnel**: prints (does not run) the Tailscale Funnel `:443` mount commands.

Pass `--no-service` to do the env/install/init steps only and skip the unit install
(useful in containers or CI where there is no user systemd bus).

### Verify

```bash
systemctl --user status skcomms-api.service
curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1:9384/health && echo ' OK'   # /healthz works identically
systemctl --user list-timers skcomms-housekeep.timer
```

The API binds loopback only (`127.0.0.1:9384`, per section 5). To make it
internet-reachable, run the Funnel mounts the bootstrap printed **on the public node**:

```bash
tailscale funnel --bg --set-path /api/v1/inbox   http://127.0.0.1:9384/api/v1/inbox
tailscale funnel --bg --set-path /api/v1/prekey  http://127.0.0.1:9384/api/v1/prekey
tailscale funnel --bg --set-path /.well-known/skfed/directory http://127.0.0.1:9384/.well-known/skfed/directory
tailscale funnel --bg --set-path /api/v1/skfed/announce      http://127.0.0.1:9384/api/v1/skfed/announce
```

Funnel `:443` is the sole ingress; no skcomms socket is ever published to a public
interface directly (section 5).

### Where secrets come from (PATHS only, never values)

Nothing in `bootstrap.sh` or the units contains a secret value.

- **Signing / identity keys** resolve at runtime from the agent's **CapAuth profile**,
  not from any file this runbook writes (section 6).
- **Per-host overrides** live in the optional `EnvironmentFile` at
  `~/.config/skcomms/skcomms.env`, referenced by every unit as `EnvironmentFile=-...`
  (the leading `-` makes it optional, so the units start on defaults if it is absent).
  The bootstrap seeds it `0600` with the bind host/port only. Put **paths** to secret
  material there (e.g. `SKCOMMS_KEYRING_DIR=/run/secrets/skcomms`), never the material
  itself. Prefer a `tmpfs`/`/run/secrets`-style path populated out of band.

### Retiring the `.41` hourly purge stopgap

`.41` currently runs a host-local hourly cron that purges the sender outbox by hand,
a stopgap from before retention shipped (the 140k-file outbox that pegged Syncthing,
section 6). `skcomms-housekeep.timer` supersedes it: it runs the same
`skcomms housekeep` pass hourly (`OnCalendar=hourly`, `Persistent=true` so a
powered-off laptop catches up one sweep on boot). Once the timer is live and has run
at least once, **remove the stopgap on `.41`**:

```bash
systemctl --user list-timers skcomms-housekeep.timer          # confirm it is armed
journalctl --user -u skcomms-housekeep.service -n 20 --no-pager   # confirm a pass ran
crontab -l                                                    # find the hourly purge line
crontab -e                                                    # delete the skcomms purge line
```

Do not remove the cron line until the timer shows at least one successful pass in the
journal, so retention coverage is never dropped.
